A fully functional blog with nice features

## Description

This was my exam project. We were given an assignment to make a blog which had full functionality made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
We were given some guidelines to follow, and had to come up with the content at our own. I choose to use the example given in the brief.

The site contains the following pages:
- Home
- Login
- Overview
- Specific page
- Edit page
- Create page

i tried to use reusable classes as much as possible for this assignment.

The most difficult thing with this project was making the login, create edit page. I had never done this or worked with a API before and struggeled a great deal with it,
But once i got in the flow, magic happened. Once logged in a access token is saved in locale storage, that autorises you to make changes to existing blog posts,
deleting blog posts and creating new posts. All in all the site functionality is great, but the styling is not so good. If i had used my time better, i would
style the page a lot better than this result.
